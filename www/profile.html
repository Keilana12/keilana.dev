<h3><strong>ABOUT ME</strong><br></h3>

<p>Hello! Welcome to my site! I'm Isabelle, the designer. I am a fourteen-year-old filipino-american that attends San Mateo High 
School. I'm a volleyball player, pole-vaulter, hula dancer, and saxophone player! I have a passion for science and 3D printing, 
and some of my favorite pastimes include playing cards, listening to music, and designing! :) My favorite movies are The A-Team 
and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. My favorite TV shows are Chuck and Firefly.<br><br></p>



<h3><strong>TRAINING</strong><br></h3>

<p>I learned design in my highschool's Art and Multimedia class, where we learned how to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator 
efficiently. Since then, I have learned a lot about the two programs by just playing around and trying out new things. I have 
studied programming since I was little, and my dad has taught me Python and Javascript in past years. This last year, I studied
 for and took the AP Computer Science A test, where I learned Java. I have also used C# on Unity, and I have experience in HTML
 and CSS. <br><br></p>
